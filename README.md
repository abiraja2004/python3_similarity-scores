# python3_similarity-scores
A python3 script which computes the similarity scores between sentences

## Description

Problem link : https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/nlp-similarity-scores

You are provided with four documents, numbered 1 to 4, each with a single sentence of text.
Determine the identifier of the document DD which is the most similar to the first document, as computed according to the TF-IDF scores.

I'd like an apple.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Never compare an apple to an orange.
I prefer scikit-learn to orange.

Output the integer DD (which may be either 2 or 3 or 4), leaving no leading or trailing spaces.

You may either compute the answer manually and submit it in plain-text mode,
or submit a program which computes the answer, in a language of your choice.
